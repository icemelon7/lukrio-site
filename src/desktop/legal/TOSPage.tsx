<li><strong>Eligibility</strong></li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&zwj;You hereby represent and warrant that you are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations and warranties set forth in these terms and to abide by and comply with these terms.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>a) You are of 18 years of age or older (21 years of age or older in Massachusetts)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>b) You are a citizen or resident of the United States of America and that you have an address in the United States of America;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>c) At the time of deposit or game entry you are physically located in the United States of America in a jurisdiction in which participation in the competition is not prohibited by applicable law;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>d) You are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>e) You will abide at all times by these Terms of Use and any other agreements between you and Lukrio regarding your use of the Service or participation in games;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>f) When depositing funds or entering a paid competition, you are not physically located in of any of the following states: Alabama, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, Texas or Washington;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>g) You are not subject to backup withholding tax because: (a) you are exempt from backup withholding, or (b) you have not been notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that you are subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all interest or dividends, or (c) the IRS has notified you that you are no longer subject to backup withholding.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>h) When entering any competition that awards prizes, you are not an employee or operator of another daily fantasy site that charges entrance fees or offers cash prizes</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>i) You do not, by virtue of affiliation with another daily fantasy site, have access to the site&rsquo;s pre-release non-public confidential data about competition-related information.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If Lukrio determines that you do not meet the eligibility requirements of this section, then you are not authorized to use the Service. Lukrio may require you to provide proof that you are eligible to participate according to this section prior to receiving a prize. This includes by requesting that you fill out an affidavit of eligibility or other verification information (as discussed in Section 4 below). If Lukrio otherwise determines that you do not meet the eligibility requirements of this section, in addition to any rights that Lukrio may have in law or equity, Lukrio reserves the right to terminate your account, withhold or revoke the awarding of any prizes associated with your account or limit your ability to withdraw. In such a situation, Lukrio may pay out any withheld or revoked prizes to the other entrants in the relevant competition in a manner consistent with the prize structure of the competition, to be precisely determined by Lukrio in its sole discretion. Lukrio also reserves the right to withhold revoked prizes to use in furtherance of its fraud prevention or anti-money laundering efforts. Lukrio employees may use the Service for the purpose of testing the user experience, but may not withdraw money or prizes except when playing in a private league. Relatives of Lukrio employees with whom they share a household are not eligible to participate in paid competitions unless they are private competitions with other Lukrio employees or household members. Lukrio consultants or promoters of the Service may play in competitions without such limitation, but only if (i) their arrangement with Lukrio does not permit them to have any access to non-public Service data or any other data not made available to all players on the Service and (ii) they do not receive any other advantages in their play on the Service.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Employees or operators of other daily fantasy sites that charge entry fees or offer cash prizes, including but not limited to Lukrio, TheDealingLeague, and individuals who, by virtue of affiliation with another daily fantasy site, have access to the site&rsquo;s pre-release non-public confidential data about game-related information may not enter any competitions in which a real money prize is awarded. If such person enters a Lukrio competition that awards prizes, Lukrio will disqualify the entry, will not award a prize, and may report such person&rsquo;s violation of this provision to the daily fantasy site for which the entrant is employed by, operates or affiliated with. Additionally, Lukrio may maintain information about the entrant sufficient to assist Lukrio in blocking the user from entering future Lukrio competitions, unless and until Lukrio determines, in its sole discretion, that the entrant is no longer an employee or operator of another daily fantasy site or no longer has access to pre-release non-public confidential data about game-related information by virtue of affiliation with a daily fantasy site.</span></p>

<li><strong>Conditions of Participation</strong></li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>&zwj;4.1 Registration</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In order to participate in a competition on the Service, you must register for an account. By registering as a user of the Service, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted (such information being the &ldquo;Registration Data&rdquo;) and maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Lukrio has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Lukrio may deny you access to areas requiring registration, or terminate your account, at its sole discretion.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>You may establish, maintain, use and control only one account on the Service. Each account on the Service may only be owned, maintained, used and controlled by one individual. For avoidance of doubt, users may not &ldquo;co-own&rdquo; accounts on the Service. In the event Lukrio determines that you have opened, maintained, used or controlled more than one account, in addition to any other rights that Lukrio may have, Lukrio reserves the right to suspend or terminate any or all of your accounts and terminate, withhold or revoke the awarding of any prizes.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>You agree that the sole and specific purpose of creating an account on Lukrio is to participate in fantasy stock market competitions on the Service. Lukrio shall be entitled to suspend, limit or terminate your account if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you are depositing funds without the intention of using them in competitions on the Service. In such circumstances, we may also report such activity to relevant authorities.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>4.2 Account Password and Security</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>At the time of registration for online account access, you must provide a valid email address and supply a Username and Password to be used in conjunction with your account. You may not use a Username that promotes a commercial venture or a Username that Lukrio in its sole discretion deems offensive. Many portions of the Service require registration for access (the "Restricted Areas"). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Password, and are fully responsible for all uses of your Username and Password, whether by you or others. You agree to (a) never to use the same Password for the Service that you use or have ever used outside of the Service; (b) keep your Username and Password confidential and not share them with anyone else; (c) immediately notify Lukrio of any unauthorized use of your Username and Password or account or any other breach of security; and (d) use only your own Username and Password to access the Service&rsquo;s Restricted Areas. Lukrio cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>You acknowledge and agree that Lukrio is authorized to act on instructions received through the use of your Username and Password, and that Lukrio may, but is not obligated to, deny access or block any transaction made through use of your Username and Password without prior notice if we believe your Username and Password are being used by someone other than you, or for any other reason.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Lukrio may require you to change your Username or may unilaterally change your Username.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>4.3 Communications and Information Practices</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As a result of your registration for the Service, you may receive certain commercial communications from Lukrio. You understand and agree that these communications are part of your registration, and that, to the extent required by law, you may opt out of receiving these communications at any time by either using the unsubscribe functionality or sending an email to info [at] Lukrio [dot] com. Following such an opt-out, we may still communicate with you via email to the extent permitted by applicable law.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>4.4 Disqualification and Cancellation</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Lukrio also reserves the right to cancel competitions, in our sole discretion, without any restrictions.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Lukrio, in its sole discretion, may disqualify you from a competition or the entire Service, refuse to award fantasy points or prizes and require the return of any prizes, or suspend, limit, or terminate your account if you engage in conduct Lukrio deems, in its sole discretion, to be improper, unfair, fraudulent or otherwise adverse to the operation of the Service or in any way detrimental to other users. Improper conduct includes, but is not limited to: falsifying personal information, including payment information, required to use the Service or claim a prize; violating eligible payment method terms, including the terms of any cash rewards payment card, violating any of these rules, accumulating points or prizes through unauthorized methods such as unauthorized scripts or other automated means; tampering with the administration of the Service or trying to in any way tamper with the computer programs associated with the Service; obtaining other entrants&rsquo; information and spamming other entrants; and abusing the Service in any way; or otherwise violating these Terms of Use. You acknowledge that the forfeiture and/or return of any prize shall in no way prevent Lukrio from informing the relevant authorities, and/or pursuing criminal or civil proceedings in connection with such conduct.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>If for any reason the Service is not running as originally planned (e.g., if the Site becomes corrupted or does not allow the proper usage and processing of entries in accordance with the rules, or if infection by a computer virus, bugs, tampering, unauthorized intervention, actions by entrants, fraud, technical failures, or any other causes of any kind, in the sole opinion of Lukrio corrupts or affects the administration, security, fairness, integrity or proper conduct of the Service), Lukrio reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify any individual implicated in or relating to the cause and/or to cancel, terminate, extend, modify or suspend the Service, and select the winner(s) from all eligible entries received. If such cancellation, termination, modification or suspension occurs, notification may be posted on the Site</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The failure of Lukrio to comply with any provision of these Terms due to an act of God, hurricane, war, fire, riot, earthquake, terrorism, act of public enemies, actions of governmental authorities outside of the control of Lukrio (excepting compliance with applicable codes and regulations) or other force majeure event will not be considered a breach of these Terms.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>4.5 Deposits and Withdrawals Generally</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>By depositing funds or entering paid competitions, you agree to provide us with a valid mailing address, date of birth and social security number and any other information we may require in order to run appropriate identity checks and comply with applicable rules and regulations. If necessary, you may be required to provide appropriate documentation that allows us to verify you. While your account is pending verification, you may be able to deposit funds into your account and participate in competitions, but you will not be able to withdraw any funds from your account until verification is complete. If we are unable to verify you, we reserve the right to suspend your account and withhold any funds until such time as we have been able to successfully verify you.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>We also may conduct checks for Terms compliance, including anti-fraud checks on playing patterns and deposits prior to processing a withdrawal, and we may request additional information before permitting a withdrawal. Subject to such checks, you may close your account and withdraw your deposits and/or winnings at any time and for any reason.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Deposits, and player winnings after competitions are finished, are held in a separate, segregated bank account by a subsidiary of Lukrio, Inc. These funds belong to you, subject to review for evidence of fraud, verification or other prohibited conduct as described above, and Lukrio may not use them to cover its operating expenses or for other purposes. Your withdrawals will be made from this segregated bank account, and checks issued from that account may bear the name of Lukrio&rsquo;s subsidiary.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Lukrio may limit the amount a user can deposit into his or her account in accordance with state-imposed deposit limits.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>In cases where you have participated in a promotion to receive a bonus or other benefit, you may be required to play through your deposit (by entering competitions) whose total entry fees equal the value of the deposit to receive the entirety of such bonus.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>4.6 Taxation</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Each year all winners who have won $600 or more over the previous year must provide updated address and social security details to Lukrio. These details will be used to allow Lukrio to comply with tax regulations and may be shared with appropriate tax authorities. You, not Lukrio, are responsible for filing and paying applicable state and federal taxes on any winnings. Lukrio does not provide tax advice, nor should any statements in this agreement or on the Service be construed as tax advice.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&zwj;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>4.7 Publicity</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>By entering a competition, you consent to Lukrio&rsquo;s and its service providers&rsquo; and business partners&rsquo; use of your name, voice, likeness, location and photograph in connection with the development, production, distribution and/or exploitation (including marketing and promotion) of the selected competition and/or other Lukrio competitions and Lukrio generally, unless otherwise prohibited by law. Lukrio Inc and its business partners reserve the right to make public statements about the entrants and winner(s), on-air, on the Internet, or otherwise, prior to, during, or following the competition. Entrants agree that Lukrio Inc may announce any winner's name on-air or on any of its websites or any other location at any time in connection with the marketing and promotion of Lukrio or other competitions or games operated by Lukrio Inc. You agree that participation in and (where applicable) the winning of a prize in connection with a competition constitute complete compensation for your obligations under this paragraph, and you agree not to seek to charge a fee or impose other conditions on the fulfillment of these obligations. The rules specific to certain competitions may contain additional publicity obligations or may require a written signature on a separate publicity waiver.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>

<ol start={5}>
<li><strong>Game Rules</strong></li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>&zwj;5.1 Game of Skill</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Lukrio is a game of skill. Winners are determined by the criteria stated in each competition's rules. For each competition, winners are determined by the individuals who use their skill and knowledge of relevant stock market information and fantasy stock trading game rules to accumulate the most fantasy money. Fantasy money is accumulated through the performance of individual stocks, ETF&rsquo;s and other fantasy trades made in your fantasy portfolio.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>5.2 Entry Fees</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Each Lukrio competition has an entry fee listed in US dollars. When you opt to participate in a competition, that amount in US dollars will be debited from your Lukrio account. Then, follow the links and instructions provided for entry. In the event of a dispute regarding the identity of the person submitting an entry, the entry will be deemed submitted by the person in whose Username the entry was submitted, or if possession of the Username itself is competitioned and in Lukrio&rsquo;s opinion sufficiently uncertain, the name in which the email address on file was registered with the email service provider. Lukrio reserves the right not to award a prize to an individual it believes in its sole discretion did not submit the winning entry.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Users may cancel entries up to 15 minutes prior to competition start. If you timely cancel an entry, your entry fee will be refunded back into your Lukrio account. Lukrio has no obligation to honor cancellation requests received within 15 minutes of or after competition start.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>5.3 Competition Term</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Lukrio offers competitions for financial markets generally taking place on a single day or week. Some competitions may last as long as one calendar year.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>5.4 Prizes</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>After each competition ends, the tentative winners are announced (generally by the following day) but remain subject to final verification. The players in each competition who accumulate the most fantasy points and comply with eligibility requirements and applicable rules will win prizes as set out in the posted competition details. Prizes are added to the winning player's account balance. In the event of a tie, the prize is divided evenly between the tied players, unless otherwise specified.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Lukrio offers a number of different types of competitions. For each competition, we announce the entry fees and prizes in advance on the competition page. For a summary of entry fees and prizes for currently open competitions please login and visit the main lobby.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Prize calculations are based on the results as of the time when final portfolio values are tabulated by Lukrio. Once winners are initially announced by Lukrio, the scoring results will not be changed in light of official adjustments made by the professional leagues, though we reserve the right to make adjustments based on errors or irregularities in the transmission of information to us from our stats provider or in our calculation of results. We also may make adjustments in the event of noncompliance with the Terms. Lukrio has no obligation to delay the awarding of a prize in anticipation of any adjustment, and we reserve the right to reverse payments in the event of any adjustment. You agree to cooperate with our efforts to reverse payments.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>No substitution or transfer of a prize is permitted. All taxes associated with the receipt or use of any prize are the sole responsibility of the winner. In the event that the awarding of any prizes to winners of the Competition is challenged by any legal authority, Lukrio reserves the right in its sole discretion to determine whether or not to award or adjust such prizes. In all disputes arising out of the determination of the winner of Lukrio competitions, Lukrio Inc is the sole judge and its actions are final and binding.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>5.5 Notification</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Winners are generally posted on the Site after the conclusion of each competition by 10 AM ET on the following day. Winners may be requested to return via email or regular mail an affidavit of eligibility, a publicity agreement and appropriate tax forms by a specified deadline. Failure to comply with this requirement can result in disqualification. Any prize notification returned as undeliverable may result in disqualification and selection of an alternate winner. In addition, a list of winners and winner's names for each competition period may be obtained by writing to: hello@lukrio.com</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>5.6 Bonuses and Promotions</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>We frequently offer bonuses to newly depositing users and for other marketing purposes. Certain bonuses are awarded as a &ldquo;pending bonus&rdquo; earned gradually when users enter and complete paid competitions. A user&rsquo;s pending bonus is converted into a monetary credit that can be used to play on Lukrio as the user enters real money competitions in accordance with the terms of the offer or promotion. Unless otherwise stated, any unconverted pending bonus remaining in a player&rsquo;s account 45 days after it has been initially credited can be removed by Lukrio. Any credit a new user receives is for entry into competitions on Lukrio and can only be withdrawn if they have been previously entered into at least one game.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Additionally, if a user immediately withdraws money after a deposit which delivers a deposit bonus then the bonus will be retracted. In the event of abuse of the bonus system by any user, Lukrio reserves the right to retract your user bonuses.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Lukrio may also offer Lukrio Points, or LP, in accordance with the terms of a promotion or for other marketing purposes at Lukrio&rsquo;s sole discretion.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>We frequently offer monetary credits for players competing in "Beat The Expert" competitions and Giveaway/Freeroll tournaments or for referring new users to Lukrio. Lukrio reserves the right to reclaim these credits if players do not use them to enter real money competitions within 1 month of their initial crediting, or within the minimum amount of time allowed by applicable law. These credits can be used to enter real money competitions but cannot be immediately withdrawn.</span></p>

<li><strong>Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</strong></li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY &ndash; IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&zwj;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>15.1 Initial Dispute Resolution</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Our Customer Support Department is available via the web address any concerns you may have regarding the Service. Our Customer Service Department can resolve most concerns quickly to our players&rsquo; satisfaction. The parties shall use their best efforts through this Customer Service process to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. Failure to engage in this process could result in the award of fees against you in arbitration.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>15.2 Binding Arbitration</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution begins under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties&rsquo; relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Except as set forth in Section 15.5, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of a third party arbitrator&rsquo;s administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The parties agree that the arbitrator may allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute. The arbitrator&rsquo;s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Any arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party&rsquo;s identity, the claims being asserted, and the factual allegations on which they are based. The arbitrator may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions for any claims the arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11).</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>15.3 Location</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&zwj;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>15.4 Class Action Waiver</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND LUKRIO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this Paragraph&rsquo;s limitations as to a particular remedy, then that remedy (and only that remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be sought in court. The parties agree, however, that any adjudication of remedies not subject to arbitration shall be stayed pending the outcome of any arbitrable claims and remedies.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&zwj;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>15.5 Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (&ldquo;intellectual property rights&rdquo; means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also elect to have disputes or claims resolved in a small claims court that are within the scope of that court&rsquo;s jurisdiction. Either party may also seek a declaratory judgment or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party&rsquo;s claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court in your state and county of residence. Seeking such relief shall not waive a party&rsquo;s right to arbitration under this agreement.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>15.6 30-Day Right to Opt Out</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to Lukrio, Inc. The notice must be sent within 30 days of 11/06/2020 or your first use of the Service, whichever is later, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Lukrio also will not be bound by them.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><span>15.7 Changes to this Section</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Lukrio will provide 30 days&rsquo; notice of any changes to this section. Changes will become effective on the 30th day. If you continue to use the site after the 30th day, you agree that any unfiled claims of which Lukrio does not have actual notice are subject to the revised clause.</span></p>

You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.</span></p>
